# Online Forum website

This project is focused on creating a fully featured Online Forum for users that includes authentication, responsiveness and intuitive design.

The project is designed to be robust and follow best use industry standards in the development process.

This repository is the Front End of the website, it leverages React, Redux-toolkit & Tailwindcss.

For the backend, this api is being called: <https://launchup-prisma.herokuapp.com/>

Note: The api is hosted on the free teir of Heroku, thus if idle it might have a delay on the first call done to it.

More information about the api endpoints can be found at in the [docs folder](docs/endpoints.md)

## Getting started

Ensure `NodeJs` is installed.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Semantic Commit Messages

All commit messages and PR titles need to follow Conventional Commits semantics.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is optional

### Example

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

More Examples:

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

## Creating a release

Just build your project, follow the Conventional Commits and every time you want to create a new release just run:

`npm run release`

It will automatically go through all the commit messages since the last tagged release, and:

- add the relevant ones to the CHANGELOG.md file;
- bump the version in package.json;
- commit and tag the release with the new version;

### Important note

Until your project reaches version 1.0.0, Standard Version will only update the PATCH number, despite the commit type, and the MINOR number with the BREAKING CHANGE text. This is an intended behaviour, because prior to version 1.0.0 you’re still in Alpha phase so this prevents major version bumps. So once you’re ready to make the first major release just run:

`npm run release -- --release-as major`

And from now on all the following releases with be in sync with the established convention.
